# Bittensor Subnet  #36

# HIP (Human Intelligence Primitive) Subnet

The HIP (Human Intelligence Primitive) Subnet is a [Bittensor](https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor) subnet designed to provide human intelligence services to other subnets. It will allow other subnets to send their data to the HIP Subnet for human evaluation, testing, and feedback. The HIP Subnet harnesses the collective intelligence of human miners who compete to provide high-quality evaluations and insights on the submitted data. Validators in the HIP Subnet assess the quality of the miners' responses and distribute rewards accordingly, creating an incentive mechanism that promotes diverse and valuable human feedback.

## Features

- **Human Intelligence Primitives**: The HIP Subnet aims to leverage human intelligence to perform tasks that require subjective judgment, contextual understanding, and creative problem-solving. Miners in the HIP Subnet are human participants who contribute their cognitive abilities to evaluate and provide feedback on data submitted by other subnets.*

- **Incentive Mechanism**: The HIP Subnet implements an incentive mechanism that rewards miners for providing high-quality evaluations and feedback. Miners compete to offer the most valuable insights, and the subnet's validators distribute rewards based on the quality and human-likeness of the miners' responses. This incentive structure encourages miners to deliver their best work and continuously improve the network's overall performance.

## Getting Started

To participate in the HIP Subnet as a miner or validator and get set-up quickly, Please follow the instructions in the respective guides bellow:

- [Mining Guide](https://github.com/HIP-Labs/HIP-Developer-Docs/blob/main/Guides/Miner/Setting_up_on_DigitalOcean.md)
- [Validator Guide](https://github.com/HIP-Labs/HIP-Developer-Docs/blob/main/Guides/Validator/Setting_up_on_RunPod.md)

It is not mandatory to use either service provided in these guides. They are provided to help you get started.

Please note that Bittensor is currently supported on macOS and Linux, with limited support for Windows.

## Reward Model

The current reward model works as follows:

When a miner submits a valid response (correct captcha or task answer), they receive the highest reward. If their response is valid but the task answer is incorrect, they receive a lower reward.

Miners who consistently provide correct answers will accumulate higher total rewards over time compared to miners who don't respond or provide incorrect answers.

The validator updates the scores of the miners based on the rewards they earn for each task. These scores are used to determine the overall performance and ranking of the miners.

As more miners start actively participating and providing correct answers, the relative rewards of the inactive or underperforming miners will decrease. This is because the active miners will be earning higher rewards, while the inactive miners will not be accumulating rewards at the same rate.

Consequently, the scores of the active and accurate miners will increase, while the scores of the inactive or inaccurate miners will relatively decrease or stagnate.

# Mining

Mining in the HIP Subnet is designed to be straightforward. Follow these steps to set up and run your miner on an Ubuntu server. We have also included a guide on how to get set up on DigitalOcean below. 

[Setting up on DigitalOcean](https://github.com/HIP-Labs/HIP-Developer-Docs/blob/main/Guides/Miner/Setting_up_on_DigitalOcean.md)


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Bittensor wallet with sufficient TAO for registration
- 2X VCPU
- 8GB RAM
- 100GB SSD

## Setting Up the Miner

1. **Clone the HIP Subnet repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HIP-LABS/HIP-Subnet.git
    ```
2. **Enter the directory where the HIP Subnet was cloned:**
    ```bash
    cd HIP-Subnet
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install python3.10-venv
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install -e .
    ```

4. **Register your Bittensor keys with the subnet:**
    ```bash
    btcli subnet register --wallet.name <YOUR_WALLET_COLDKEY> --wallet.hotkey <YOUR_WALLET_HOTKEY> --netuid 36 --subtensor.network finney
    ```
    Replace `<YOUR_WALLET_COLDKEY>` and `<YOUR_WALLET_HOTKEY>` with your corresponding keys.

5. **Confirm your key is registered to the subnet:**
    ```bash
    btcli w inspect --wallet.name <YOUR_WALLET_COLDKEY> --wallet.hotkey <YOUR_WALLET_HOTKEY> --netuid 36 --subtensor.network finney
    ```

## Running the Miner

To ensure that the miner and server run continuously, we will use `pm2`.

1. **Install Node.js and `pm2`:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm
    sudo npm install pm2@latest -g
    ```

2. **Ensure your virtual environment is activated:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Run the miner server with `pm2`:**
    ```bash
    pm2 start ./scripts/run_miner_frontend.sh --name miner_server
    ```
   > 3.1 <em>(Alternative to PM2)</em> <br>
   >**Run the miner server with `systemcl`:**
   >```bash
   >chmod +x /scripts/setup_uvicorn_service.sh
   >./scripts/setup_uvicorn_service.sh
   >```

5. **Run the miner script with `pm2`:**
    ```bash
    pm2 start --interpreter python3 --name miner -- neurons/miner.py --wallet.name <YOUR_WALLET_COLDKEY> --wallet.hotkey <YOUR_WALLET_HOTKEY> --netuid 36 --subtensor.network finney --logging.debug --logging.trace
    ```

6. **Save the `pm2` process list and corresponding environments:**
    ```bash
    pm2 save
    ```

7. **Set `pm2` to start on boot:**
    ```bash
    pm2 startup
    ```

## Accessing the Miner Frontend

The miner frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001` from your chosen web browser.

## Managing `pm2` Processes

- To check the status of your processes:
    ```bash
    pm2 status
    ```

- To restart a process:
    ```bash
    pm2 restart <process_name>
    ```

- To stop a process:
    ```bash
    pm2 stop <process_name>
    ```

For further assistance, refer to the [PM2 documentation](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) to manage and keep your miner application online 24/7.

# Validating

Setting up a HIP validator involves configuring a server with specific hardware requirements. Follow these steps to set up and run your validator on an Ubuntu server.

We have made a short guide on how to set up your validator using runpod here: [Setting up on RunPod](https://github.com/HIP-Labs/HIP-Developer-Docs/blob/main/Guides/Validator/Setting_up_on_RunPod.md)
